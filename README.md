# tCHu: Swiss Railway Adventure  (DEMO HERE)[]

**tCHu** is a two-player game inspired by the Swiss version of the famous board game "Ticket to Ride." In this variant, players compete to complete various objectives by connecting different cities across Switzerland and neighboring countries using railway routes.

## Getting Started

To start playing the game, follow these steps:

**1. Run the Server:**
   - Execute `ServerMain.java` to initialize the game server.

**2. Run the Client:**
   - Execute `ClientMain.java` to start the client and connect to the server.

## How to Play

**Drawing Cards:**
   - To draw a specific card, simply click on the card you want from the available selection.
   - Alternatively, you can click on the "Cartes" button to draw a random card from the deck.

**Claiming Routes:**
   - To claim a route, click on the desired route on the map.
   - If the route is a tunnel, you may need to provide additional cards depending on the conditions specified in the game.

## Game Objective

Players aim to achieve a set of objectives represented by tickets in their possession. These tickets require players to connect specific cities on the map. Successfully completing a ticket earns points, while failure to do so results in a point deduction.

For example, a ticket may require you to connect the cities of Bern and Geneva. If you manage to do this before the end of the game, you will earn points. However, if you fail, you will lose points.

## Additional Rules

* Players can draw new tickets during the game by selecting three from the deck and choosing to keep at least one.
* The game concludes when a player has two or fewer wagons left. At this point, each player gets one more turn before the final scoring.

## End of the Game

The game ends when a player has two or fewer wagons remaining. After each player takes one final turn, points are tallied, and the player with the highest score is declared the winner.
